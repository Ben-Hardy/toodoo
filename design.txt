basic idea:
- each entry has a unique identifier
- keep track of current entries as well as completed entries
- can rank items by priority: low, med, hi. default priority is med
- can mark entries as completed, and also can re-add entries by ID
- store completed entries so they can be reviews
- list will be stored as a text file in user's home repository
- possibility of setting list path so it can be stored elsewhere if user wants to make a git repo of it or something
- unique identifier can be a 4 char (alphanumeric) number. will give ~1.6 million unique entries before it overlaps. 
  more than 4 starts to get awkward for the user to work with
- add a REPL for working with the list in a more continuous manner rather than atomically
